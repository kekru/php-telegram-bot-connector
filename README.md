# php-telegram-bot-connector
This is a small library to write Telegram Bots with PHP.  

It supports sending text and images to a telegram chat.  
Look in the example file to see how to write a bot.  

This library does not cover all features of the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api), like special keyboard-buttons or inline features. But its simple and good in sending text and images.
