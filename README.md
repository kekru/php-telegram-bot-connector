# php-telegram-bot-connector
This is a small library to write Telegram Bots in PHP.   

It supports sending texts and images to a Telegram chat.  
Look in the example file to see how to write a bot.  

This library does not cover all features of the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api), like special keyboard-buttons or inline features, but it's simple to use and good in sending texts and images.
